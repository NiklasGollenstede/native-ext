This is the API documentation of the [`/index.js`](..index.js) module. For a conceptual description of NativeExt, see the [`/README.md`](../README.md).

## Loading the module

```js
const Native = await require.async('node_modules/native-ext/');
```

The browser API of native-ext currently requires [`web-ext-utils`](https://github.com/NiklasGollenstede/web-ext-utils) as a peer-dependency.
At least the file
 * `node_modules/web-ext-utils/utils/event.js`

must be loadable. The `require` above is the global value set by `pbq/require.js`, but other AMD loaders should work as well.


# API -- OUTDATED

```js
async function require(path, { onDisconnect, } = { }) { return exports; }
/**
 * Requires a file included in the extension inside the NativeExt node.js process and returns a unique remote
 * representation of its exports. All require calls are directed at the same process, which is kept alive until
 * all returned exports objects or functions are `unref()`ed.
 * @param  {string}    path           Path to the node module file relative from the extension root.
 *                                    May omit the '.js' extension.
 * @param  {function}  .onDisconnect  Optional. A callback (error?) => void that is called if the connection to
 *                                    the native process terminates before the exports value is `unref()`ed.
 *                                    Ignored if exports is not a object or function.
 * @return {object|function|any}      If the value exported by the required module is a primitive,
 *                                    then that primitive. If it is a function, then an asynchronous
 *                                    mulitport/Port (https://github.com/NiklasGollenstede/multiport)
 *                                    callback wrapper of that function.
 *                                    Otherwise an object whose direct properties are remote callbacks
 *                                    if they were functions or JSON values otherwise.

function unref(ref) { return unrefed; }
/**
 * Drops the reference a non-primitive value returned by `require()` holds on the remote process.
 * Once all references are dropped, that is,`unref()` was called (at least once) on any non-primitive returned
 * by `require()`, the remote process is terminated to free it's resources. All callbacks exchanged with the
 * native process, which don't hold references themselves, will stop working at that point.
 * @param  {object|function}  ref  A non-primitive value that was returned by `require()`.
 * @return {bool}                  `true` iff the reference count was actually decreased,
 *                                 `false` e.g. if `unref()` was called with the same value twice.
